# brave-debullshitinator
Removes unessasary bloat from Brave Browser.

-------

# What is disabled?

The following items are disabled by appling brave debullshitinator:

* Brave rewards & Wallet
* Brave VPN
* Brave AI/Leo (some people may like Leo, in which case you can reenable it following the [customization guide](https://github.com/MulesGaming/brave-debullshitinator/wiki/Customization))
* IPFS protocol
* Changes Brave's ad-ridden homepage to [start.duckduckgo.com](https://start.duckduckgo.com)
* Disables the password manager (I recommend using a third party password manager such as [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com) or [Proton Pass](https://proton.me/pass) that isn't tied to Brave sync or any one browser.)

-------

# How does it work?

Brave debullshitinator uses [group policies](https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039248271-Group-Policy) typically used to manage organisations browsers to force disable fetures. Group policies are the only way to completly hide these fetures from settings and context menus.
